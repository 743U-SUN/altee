Anyone here trying to do the same on windows? any success?

Me windows10

so far i installed wsl and tried any mcp. no success. even if i see 'connected' in /mcp still it does not works and returns errors.

then i tried ubuntu docker (and previously i tried WSL2), i managed to get /mcp connected status, but was unable to scan ports for connection, so i guess 'connected' status only meant that server

u/agentdeskaibrowser-tools-mcp@1.2.0""@agentdeskai/browser-tools-mcp@1.2.0"

was running.

this is part of

.claude.json

(this file can be found in /root/) - docker ubuntu

(In WSL i could locate that file at (\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\macoha\) - WSL2

"mcpServers": {
"browser-tools": {
"type": "stdio",
"command": "npx",
"args": [
"-y",
"@agentdeskai/browser-tools-mcp@1.2.0"
],
"env": {
"BROWSERTOOLS_SERVER_HOST": "host.docker.internal",
"BROWSERTOOLS_SERVER_PORT": "3025"
}
}
}

as you can see i even tried to guess env - with it or without - same story.

i fear that due to its enclosed nature, wsl's claude code or docker's claude code is unable to communicate with server

u/agentdeskai/browser-tools-server@1.2.0

that communicates with chrome extension

BrowserTools MCP1.2.0

ps. i am able to run mcp's on cursor ide no problem. issues are with docker, WSL. i feel like i had read every post, guide, video and tried everything. i was trying to do that for a whole sad day :(

ps2. it works i hope i help someone :) if so, get me a beer! (this is for ubuntu docker version)
my bat file in autostart:

u/echo off
cd /d D:\git
start /min powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -Command "npx u/agentdeskai/browser-tools-server@1.2.0 --host 0.0.0.0"

my mcp settings in .claude.json

  "mcpServers": {
    "browser-tools": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@agentdeskai/browser-tools-mcp@1.2.0"
      ],
      "env": {
        "BROWSER_TOOLS_HOST": "host.docker.internal",
        "BROWSER_TOOLS_PORT": "3025"
      }
    }
  }

Took me about 30 min to figure this out, but Claude stores the GLOBAL MCP servers in a top level `mcpServers` property inside the `/Users/USERNAME/.claude.json`. I have no idea why they don't mention this in their docs, but I hope people find it when looking for this.
